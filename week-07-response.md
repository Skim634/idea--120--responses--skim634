I agree that the internet can systematically frighten and traumatize children. 
A lot of videos do contain a level of horror and violence that can really be detrimental to a child’s psyche. 
The problem she poses with the algorithm of youtube has also been an apparent problem for a while. 
Youtube have implemented tactics to draw a parents’ or childrens’ attention to their videos and advertising that accompanied these videos.
An example is the copying and pirating of other contents such as shows to generate mass amounts of revenue. 
Even though a huge number of these videos are created by bots and viewed by bots, and even commented on by bots, a lot of videos get playback value by stealing content. 
	A problem I do not agree with is her problem with “the degree of automation which is at work here; how to parse out the gap between human and machine”. 
  As technology advances and the landscape of the internet becomes more complex, the intertwining of machine and human is inevitable. 
Though there are a lot of problems arising from a single platform like youtube, the entirety of youtube can not be monitored.
It’s an endless sea of videos and sifting through every crook and nanny of this platform would take multiple lifetimes.
But I do agree that Youtube should have a sense of responsibility to deal with the radicalisation of their viewers due to the content displayed on their platform. 
Though it’s been known that they show no inclination to tackle this daunting task.
