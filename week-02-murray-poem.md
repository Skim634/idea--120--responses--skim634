The human mind is never measurable in potential
Its the human mind that built the camera- our mechanical eye, developed artifical intelligence, and tended to the digital landscale of the internet
These digital landscapes are beings of 1000 faces, infinite in its resources
The computer has become the vessel in which we move through this landscape
Facelessly being able to taste all fruits of knowledge
