The photo realistic 3d background of led wall screens solves numerous problems that arose from green screens.
First, its ability to follow the motion of the camera solves the problem of restricted camera angles while using a green screen, allowing for different cinematic techniques to be implemented.
Also the lighting from the led wall screens is a key benefit for virtual sets. 
They provide realistic colors and reflections on actors and props which can not be achieved by green screen
Ultimately the led wall screen allows for the characters to seem more embedded in their environments.
