Southbound in the sky by Sungwon Kim

say you are travelling  
sitting on a bus together with your mother
she sits and weeps again
it's a little noisy

No matter whether it's a high school bus or the NYC subway, you encounter all types of people 
The man who drives a local bus
The checkout girl
Or the lady waiting for a bus sitting on bricks

it will open up a new world
hundreds of buses over 91 routes covering over one thousand route-miles
different colored lines with dots along them that represent the different busses and stops
opening a new world

mom is living with ovarian cancer
she sits and weeps 
“Pull the cord!”
it's a little noisy

I'm Getting on the Bus to the Other World
50¢ Regular and 25¢ Discounted fare 
Southbound in the sky
enjoying the trip
