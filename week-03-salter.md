I feel as if 386 DX's counterculture to the insurgence of fashionable technologies can be considered Gesamtkunstwerk. 
386 DX was able to sing classic pop songs from lyric sheets saved as plain text via its rudimentary text-to-speech capabilities. 
It questions the line between computer and user in digital production and performances in public spaces like a street corner. 
Not only is 386 DX able to sing songs but also exudes emotions like cheerfulness, melancholy, and exuberance. 
It used the Creative Soundblaster card to ultimately entrance its viwers with a sense of pathos.
